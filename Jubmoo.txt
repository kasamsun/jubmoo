About: ===============
	I first wrote this game in 1994 on my spare time. this time
i have studied C Window programming. From my curiousness, i found
that MS-Hearts use nddeapi.dll. Something occur, what is it? how can
I make the game like this? because i love 'Jubmoo' in Thai style
which i love to play with my friend. so i've studied SDK for Win3.1,
yahoo, i knew that. It's Network DDE ! I could make it.

History: =============
1/12/94	it has been released with no computer player that
		can play smart enough. i almost played on network with
		my friend
18/6/95	Improve everything. eliminate major,minor bug.
 9/9/96	I have add smart computer player. ( much better than
		the first release, but not much more than human )
28/2/98	Recompile and modify something to run on Win95.

Trouble shooting: ====
	:I found some error, when play on Win NT4.0. screen error.
but can play. and will have error dialog show up at starting up.
don't worry about it. 'spawn' function take different effect on Win NT.
	:Sometimes, maybe you can't play network game. i don't know why.
You may restart your computer
